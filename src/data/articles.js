						RAGs were initially praised for helping to mitigate the issue of LLM hallucinations by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources. However, they faced a key limitation when it came to answering global questions over an entire dataset, such as identifying the overarching themes in a knowledge corpus.

						This article discusses how GraphRAG overcomes these challenges by leveraging graph-based methods to create a more holistic and context-aware solution for question answering at both local and global levels.
